## Database

SQLite — stored in `expensetracker.db` (auto-created on first run).

| Table    | Columns                                |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| users    | id, name, monthly_budget               |
| expenses | id, user_id, category, amount, date    |

## Architecture

```
Main (CLI + Scanner)
  │
  ▼
Service Layer (validation, business rules, BudgetMonitor thread)
  │
  ▼
DAO Layer (JDBC, PreparedStatement, SQL)
  │
  ▼
SQLite Database
```

Each layer has a single responsibility — Main handles user interaction, Services handle logic and validation, DAOs handle SQL queries. This separation means changing the database only requires modifying the DAO layer.
